Simulation experiments

The simulation experiment consists of two parts: 1) repeated game experiments to estimate payoffs and cooperation rates between strategies; 2) evolution experiments to simulate the frequency dynamics of strategies. All evolution experiment codes and repeated prisoner's dilemma games codes is written in JAVA on Eclipse (Version: Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a)). The estimation codes of payoffs and cooperation rates for stochastic games and public goods games are written in MATLAB (R2020b).
