All evolution experiment codes and repeated prisoner's dilemma games codes is written in JAVA on Eclipse (Version: Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a)). The estimation codes of payoffs and cooperation rates for stochastic games and public goods games are written in MATLAB (R2020b).

1. We explain the use of experiment codes with Eclipse below:
     -Download and install JDK
     -Download and install Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
     -Download the experimental code and import it into Eclipse
     -Run .java file with main function

2. Next, we also explain the use of experiment codes with Matlab:
     -Download and install Matlab
     -Download the experimental code and open it with Matlab
     -Run .m file with main function
